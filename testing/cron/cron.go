Package cron provides a function to run a test only in Travis CI cron
runs, and retry the test with increasing delays a few times before
failing the build.

The primary purpose of this method is to allow cron test that are
non-hermetic and run against live (usually http) endpoints. Since the
live endpoints could occasionally throw errors, there is built-in retry
with delays between attempts.
